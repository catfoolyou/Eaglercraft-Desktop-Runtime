## Eaglercraft 1.5.2 Desktop Runtime (22w43a)

Desktop client for Eagler 1.5.2. The only point of using this is if the web or offline HTML version lags to much. Of course you need a server as there is no singleplayer, join a localhost server to play. 

Run the batch files in BOTH bukkit and bungee folders to run the server, then connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:25565`

To play this, you will need to download the repo and launch the jar file in the main directory to play. Unlike the 1.8.8 desktop runtime, this comes with both Linux and Windows support out of the box.

Make sure you have at least Java 8 installed and on your path, then run launch.bat if you are on Windows or launch.sh if you are on Linux
